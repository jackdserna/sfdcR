# sfdcR
R Package for Salesforce integration

Currently in prototpye development...

Full package distribution kinks need to be worked out for a public release, but most vital functions are ready to be equipped to users. Some issues to overcome have been related to the complexity of understanding Salesforce object and field metadata across many instances. Functions need more user testing among beta feedback user groups, and once this gets underway there could be more opportunities for useful functions. 

A wishlist of functions I'd like to include, if they can be generalized, includes:
- deduplication tool: set parameters to find duplicate records in your Salesforce data
- insert/upsert and delete functions: similar to query and update functions
- include bulk query methods where batch methods cannot obtain specific field type data
